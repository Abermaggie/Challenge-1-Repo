## Horiseon Coding Refresh- Accessibility Focus

## Description
This project was initiated by Horiseon Social Solution Service,Inc.  Horiseon is a company that focuses on online visiblity management and is interested in upgrading their current website code to include more accessible elements.  While adding accessibility to the page, the coding of this project was also trimmed to follow a logical and concise structure that will make it easier for future coders to locate key elements for future edits or updates to be added to current lay out. (For more information on trimmed code, please look at comments included within the HTML and CSS files.)

Updated accessibility features include:
1. Header title shown in browser tab updated to a unique identifier that details company name and their purpose.
2. Upon hovering over hyperlinks in navigation bar, links change colors to denote they are clickable and will move you around the page.
3. All images on page have a detailed "alt" text that can be read by speech readers or platforms that cannot view the images.
4. Structure of the web page shows a logical and visually appealing flow.
5. All hyperlinks are active and available to use.
